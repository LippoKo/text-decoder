# Text Decoder Application

We will be working on an application that encrypts texts. This way, you can exchange secret messages with others who know the secret of the encryption used.

### Encryption "Keys":

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

### Requirements:

- The application should work only with lowercase letters.
- No accented letters or special characters should be used.
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.

### Examples:
- "gato" => "gaitober"
- "gaitober" => "gato"

### Functionality:
- The application will have fields for entering the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
- Users can choose between encryption and decryption.
- The result will be displayed on the screen.
